THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL. YOU GO AND CATCH RAIN. IT IS LIKE A CHILDHOOD YOU NEVER HAD.
This is what whill happen.
We create a score variable
Next create an array of raindrops
Than a create catcher to catch the raindrops.
One raindrop falls
Make catcher follow mouse
Check to see if the raindrop touches the catcher
If the raindrop touches the catcher, score increases and raindrop goes poof
After a a while the next raindrop falls
